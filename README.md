# CountyConnect-
Citizen Feedback &amp; Accountability Platform.

CountyConnect,is a modern citizen feedback and accountability platform designed to strengthen transparency, responsiveness, and trust between local governments and their citizens.
 Inspired by civic tech platforms such as FixMyStreet and Ushahidi, CountyConnect provides a comprehensive digital ecosystem where citizens can report county issues 
 (e.g., broken infrastructure, service delays, corruption), 
 attach photo and location evidence, and track progress in real time as county officials respond.
